    <h1>Bohemian Rhapsody</h1>
    <h2>Queen</h2>
    <p>Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality.
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see.
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low.
Anyway the wind blows
Doesn't really matter to me, to me. </p>
